### INGREDIENTS

* 1 block tofu, pressed
* 1 handful curry leaves
* ½ onion, chopped
* 1 inch piece ginger, minced
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1 tomato, chopped
* ½ tsp mustard seeds
* ½ tsp fennel seeds
* ½ tsp cumin seeds
* 2-3 cloves
* 2-3 cardamom pods
* ¼ inch piece cinnamon stick
* ½ tsp ground cumin
* ½ tsp ground coriander
* ½ tsp turmeric
* ½ tsp chili powder
* ½ tsp oil

### PROCESS

heat a large pan on medium heat. add your oil and then add the bay leaves, mustard + fennel + cumin seeds, cloves and cardamom pods. mix them around in the oil until the mustard seeds start to pop.

now add the onions and cook for a few minutes until they're translucent.

add the ginger and garlic and cook for about a minute. next up is the curry leaves. cook for another minute and add your tofu and spices. mix around for a couple minutes, add tomatoes and cover.

let cook for several minutes until tomatoes have broken down to your liking.

feel free to mix some fresh green leafies like kale or spinach.

#### Tip

to press tofu, i usually place it between 2 large plates and stack some more plates or a cast iron skillet on top. about 5 to 10 minutes should do.
